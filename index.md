# Designed and Constructed in Copenhagen
{: .fs-9 }

This Brass Lamp was designed to be as fun as it use useful. Made of brass, walnut, rice paper, and a microcontroller, these documents will explain the design, experiments, construction, and implementation so that you may build one yourself.

## Features

### Illumination Brightness

The five brass toggles allow for the fine adjustment of the lamp's brightness from 0 to 800 lumens. The left-most toggle will turn the lamp off. The right-most toggle will set the lamp to it's maximum brightness of 800 lumens.

When adjusting brightness, a light press of a toggle will be confirmed by gentle haptic feedback on press and release.

### Color Temperature

The same toggles that control the brightness also adjust the color temperature of the lamp from 2700k to 7000k. The settings are akin to warm, warm white, cool white, daylight, and cool daylight; with the left-most toggle being warm 2700k and the right-most toggle being 7000k.

When adjusting temperature, a firm press of a toggle will be confirmed first, by the same haptic feedback as the brightness adjustment, followed by a second haptic vibration. This operation will not effect brightness.
