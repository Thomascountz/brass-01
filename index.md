# Countz Research âš‡
{: .fs-10 .fw-700 }

I enjoy writing a [blog](https://thomascountz.com/), but it's here that I write archival/contemporaneous notes that may or may not lead to a final product. It's a place to organize my project notes, ideas, and observations, while also documenting my research, resources, and explorations.

## [Off The Record - Build-your-own ActiveRecord](/docs/off-the-record)
{: .fs-6 .mb-3}

Active
{: .label .label-green .m-0}

Together we'll write a feature-light database ORM (object-relational mapping) tool in Ruby; a VERY feature-light [ActiveRecord](https://github.com/rails/rails/tree/main/activerecord), if you will. In the process, we'll learn more about databases, meta-programming, test-driven development, and ActiveRecord itself.

## [Pilot - Digial Hydrometer](/docs/pilot)
{: .fs-6 .mb-3}

Archived
{: .label .label-yellow .m-0 }

Pilot is a design for a digital hydrometer used to measure the progression of home brewing alcoholic beverages. Pilot uses an accelerometer, wireless communication, and the principles of buoyancy to determine the specific gravity of the brewing liquid.

## [How to Make (Almost) Anything](/docs/HTMAA)
