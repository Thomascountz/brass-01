# Research
{: .fs-9 }

I enjoy writing a [blog](https://thomascountz.com/), but it's here that I write archival/contemporaneous notes that may or may not lead to a final product. It's a place to organize my project notes, ideas, and observations, while also documenting my research, resources, and explorations.

Pages may be reorganized/updated spontaneously. If you're interested, this wiki is backed by git and [you can find the version history publically on Github](https://github.com/thomascountz/research).
