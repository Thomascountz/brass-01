# Countz Research âš‡
{: .fs-10 .fw-700 }

I enjoy writing a [blog](https://thomascountz.com/), but it's here that I write archival/contemporaneous notes that may or may not lead to a final product. It's a place to organize my project notes, ideas, and observations, while also documenting my research, resources, and explorations.

[How to Make (Almost) Anything](https://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/MAS.863/) is a class taught by [Neil Gershenfeld](http://ng.cba.mit.edu/neil/bio/), the Director of [The Center for Bits and Atoms](http://cba.mit.edu/) at MIT. In this project, I log my journey as I learn about CAD, laser cutting, 3D printing, molding, PCB fabrication, firmware development, and more to build a final project.

Pilot is a design for a digital hydrometer used to measure the progression of home brewing alcoholic beverages. Pilot uses an accelerometer, wireless communication, and the principles of buoyancy to determine the specific gravity of the brewing liquid.
