# How to Make (Almost) Anything
{: .fs-9 }

[How to Make (Almost) Anything](https://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/MAS.863/) is a class taught by [Neil Gershenfeld](http://ng.cba.mit.edu/neil/bio/), the Director of [The Center for Bits and Atoms](http://cba.mit.edu/) at MIT.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

In this well-known course, students are taught how to design, plan, prototype, fabricate, and document projects that explore the boundary between computer science and the physical world by "...turning data into things and things into data."

The course materials and previous students' projects are available [online](https://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/MAS.863/), so I decided to follow along at home and build some fun projects at the fab lab's around Copenhagen.
