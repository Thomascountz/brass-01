# Hydrometer Scales
## Specific Gravity (SG)

The Specific Gravity scale is relative to the _weight_ of water. `1.000` is the SG of water at `4ºC`.

## Potential Alcohol

The Potential Alcohol scale is used specifically for alcoholic beverage brewing. The typical scale ranges from 0 to 20 percent. Using this scale before fermentation will tell a brewer how much sugar could potentially be consumed to create a certain percentage of alcohol in the final beverage. In order to determine a final alcohol percentage, a second reading is taken _after_ fermentation. Subtracting the first reading by the second will give the brewer a final alcohol percentage.

## Brix & Plato

The Brix Scale is based on the percentage of sugar in liquid by weight. Typical scales range from 0 to 30 and the number represents the percentage of sugar in the liquid _by weight_. For example, a reading of `15ºBx` in a `100g` sample means that there are `15g` of sugar in the liquid being measured. The Plato Scale is nearly interchangeable, but instead of being said to measure _sugar_, it’s said to measure _dissolved solids_, i.e. not everything factored into ºP is considered "fermentable."

## Sugar

The Sugar Scale gives a reading of ounces of sugar per gallon. For example, a reading of `15` means that there are `15oz` per `1` gallon of liquid.

## Calculation

There are conversion charts and calculators to convert to different scales for different needs. Typical glass hydrometers are calibrated with liquids at a specific temperature (old ones for brewing at `15C` and newer ones at `20C`), so it’s important to also take the temperature of the liquid you’re measuring. The weight of a liquid can be calculated based on different temperatures, so it isn’t necessary to try to adjust the temperature before taking a reading.
