# Housing for Electronics

⚠️ _**TODO**: Once a bill of materials has been finalized I can design an appropriate housing._

## iSpindle

The iSpindle community has developed several versions of a 3D-printable "[drawer](https://github.com/universam1/iSpindel/tree/master/drawer)," to hold and balance the various electronics and ballasts. I wish to take a similar approach.

## Tilt

The Tilt seems to employ a plastic mechanism for housing the electronics, offset from center, in order to cause the device to tilt while floating.
