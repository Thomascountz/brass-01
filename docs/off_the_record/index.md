# Off The Record - Build-your-own ActiveRecord
{: .fs-9 }

[Off The Record](#) is a research project design to take us on a deep dive into [ActiveRecord](https://github.com/rails/rails/tree/main/activerecord), meta-programming, library design, and databases.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

This project assumes the reader is familiar with Ruby, ActiveRecord, and SQL. You do not need to be an expert, (I'm DEFINITELY not...). Curiosity and resourcefulness are the best qualities if we get stuck.

## [Na√Øve Querying](#){: .text-grey-dk-000 }
{: .fs-6 .mb-3}

What does it look like to query the database without [ActiveRecord](https://github.com/rails/rails/tree/main/activerecord)? How do we build the API that we're used to? What can we abstract away? How do we compare?
